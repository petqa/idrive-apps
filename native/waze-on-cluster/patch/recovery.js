/* recovery.js — the safety net for the carplay and aapd patches (PATCH.md
 * "Boot recovery"). A patch that makes the head unit restart, whether the
 * patched binary crashes or another process does, loops it with the patched
 * binary still on disk and no HMI to turn the patch off. Each service has
 * its own counter. On a head unit that refuses our parts (head_unit.js) a
 * patch of ours is restored before its service starts, whatever the
 * counter.
 *
 *   recovery.js boot [carplay|aapd]
 *                      waze-on-cluster-boot.service (carplay) and
 *                      waze-on-cluster-aa-boot.service (aapd), oneshots
 *                      ordered before their service: count the previous
 *                      boot, record this one before the service starts
 *                      and, at the threshold, restore the original first.
 *   recovery.js        waze-on-cluster-recovery.service: watches both for
 *                      the rest of the boot, records each crash the moment
 *                      it is seen and a healthy start once the service has
 *                      run HEALTHY_MS. Where recmgr loaded a service's entry
 *                      it also restores at the threshold and starts the
 *                      service again, for as long as the head unit stays up.
 *
 * The boot step decides from small files only: the backup's presence, the
 * patch record (patch_record.js: whether the binary about to start is our
 * patch, and of a proven build), the service's state file, the previous
 * boot's shutdown mark and, without one, the restart records of recmgr and
 * crashhandler. It reads a binary only to restore it.
 *
 * A service's state ({fails, unknown, arm, prev, starts, ended}): fails,
 * the failed patched boots and crashes since the last healthy boot;
 * unknown, the patched boots in a row since then that ended with no
 * record; arm, this boot's record ({boot, at, patch, crashes, ran,
 * confirmed, clean}), written before a patched binary starts; prev, the
 * last boot counted; starts ({boot, n}), the starts made this boot; ended
 * ({boot, run}), the last run whose end was handled. At the next boot the
 * armed boot counts only on evidence (tally): a crash of the service, or a
 * restart recmgr or crashhandler recorded. A healthy boot clears the count,
 * an orderly one (a switch-off, a restart asked for) or one the service
 * never ran in keeps it, and two boots in a row with no record at all
 * count one. A proven patch is restored at 2 failed boots or crashes with
 * no healthy boot between, an unproven one at 1 (THRESHOLD).
 *
 * shutdown_mark.sh (a var-opt-ro.service drop-in) records at each NSM
 * shutdown, before /var/opt goes read-only, whether each service was
 * running, failed or stopped, "crash" when recmgr or crashhandler asked
 * for that restart, and the boot's uptime. An orderly reboot stops the
 * watcher while the system is stopping (arm.clean); patchd records a
 * restart the user asked for in restart-requested.
 *
 * The restore writes the backup whole, verified against the SHA-256 its
 * record took (or, with no record, the proven stock file's SHA-256), over a
 * target of the backup's own build, atomically and
 * fsynced, under the remount lock shared with patchd, with / read-write
 * only for the write. Each remount is bounded (STEP_MS); a boot step gives
 * up at BOOT_BOUND_MS whatever hangs and exits by BOOT_EXIT_MS, after one
 * bounded try to put / back read-only. It never kills, restarts or reboots
 * anything; the only start is `systemctl start` of the service after a
 * crash or a SIGKILL patchd did not send, never stop or restart, bounded by
 * START_DELAYS_MS per boot.
 *
 * Node 8.16.2 on the unit. No dependencies.
